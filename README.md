# Progress Data Table

This project is a table that displays progress data for a set of students in a course. It is built using Next.js 13.1 and the Adobe Spectrum UI library.

## Requirements

The table should display the following columns:
- Student name (string)
- Course name (string)
- Module name (string)
- Lesson name (string)
- Progress (number between 0 and 100)
- Actions (buttons to view/edit the progress)

The table should display data for at least 10 students and 5 courses.

The progress data should be stored in a JSON file or an API endpoint.

The table should allow sorting by any column and pagination.

The table should be styled using the Adobe Spectrum UI library and follow its design guidelines.

The table should be responsive and look good on desktop and mobile devices.

The table should have a clean and modern design.

## Deliverables
- A GitHub repository containing the code for the table.
- A live demo of the table hosted on a public server.

## Evaluation
We will evaluate the test task based on the following criteria:
- Use of Next.js 13.1 and the Adobe Spectrum UI library.
- Code quality, including readability, maintainability, and performance.
- Adherence to the requirements and design guidelines.
- Functionality, including sorting, pagination, and actions buttons.
- Responsiveness and compatibility with different devices and browsers.

This test task should help you evaluate the candidate's skills in building tables with progress data using Next.js and the Adobe Spectrum UI library. You can modify the requirements or evaluation criteria as needed to fit your specific project needs.
Good luck!
